# Nester
A Figma plugin that will nest any object that resides above (but not inside) a frame.

## How to use
Run Nester and it will detect if any object sits completely above another frame, and nest it inside. If the object overlaps the bounds of the frame and is not completely within a frame's bounds, it will leave the object as is.
